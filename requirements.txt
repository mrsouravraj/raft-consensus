# Raft Consensus Algorithm - Educational Implementation
# 
# This is an educational implementation with minimal dependencies
# to focus on the core Raft algorithm concepts.

# No external dependencies required for core functionality!
# The implementation uses only Python standard library modules.

# Optional dependencies for development and testing:

# Testing framework (optional - can run tests with unittest module)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Code formatting and linting (optional)
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=5.0.0
# mypy>=1.0.0

# Documentation generation (optional)
# sphinx>=5.0.0
# sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0

# Note: This educational implementation intentionally avoids external dependencies
# to demonstrate that Raft can be implemented using only standard library
# components. In production systems, you would typically use:
# - Proper networking libraries (asyncio, twisted, etc.)
# - Serialization frameworks (protobuf, msgpack, etc.)
# - Persistent storage backends (rocksdb, leveldb, etc.)
# - Monitoring and metrics libraries (prometheus_client, etc.)
